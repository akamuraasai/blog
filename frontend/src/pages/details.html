                <p><strong>It’s no secret</strong> that the digital industry is booming. From exciting
                    startups to global brands,
                    companies are
                    reaching out to digital agencies, responding to the new possibilities available. However, the
                    industry is
                    fast becoming overcrowded, heaving with agencies offering similar services — on the surface, at
                    least.<br>
                    Producing creative, fresh projects is the key to standing out. Unique side projects are the best
                    place to
                    innovate, but balancing commercially and creatively lucrative work is tricky. So, this article looks
                    at how
                    to make side projects work and why they’re worthwhile, drawing on lessons learned from our
                    development of
                    the ux ompanion app.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Integrate Side Projects?</h2>

                <p>Being creative within the constraints of client briefs, budgets and timelines is the norm for most
                    agencies.
                    However, investing in research and development as a true, creative outlet is a powerful addition. In
                    these
                    side projects alone, your team members can pool their expertise to create and shape their own vision
                    — a
                    powerful way to develop motivation, interdisciplinary skills and close relationships.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <h3>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve<br>
                        got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all.</h3>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Building into the identity and culture of an agency can also lead to new client work. These projects
                    act as
                    a
                    road map, showing clients exciting new technologies and ideas that will differentiate you from
                    competitors.
                    One
                    of our earliest projects turned our website into a brochure, optimized for the first iPad’s touch
                    interactions.
                    By demonstrating the final product, we went on to win a project to create a similar product for a
                    new
                    client.
                </p>

                <h4>How To Make Side Projects Work</h4>

                <p>We’re still working on achieving that perfect balance between commerce and creativity. But we
                    have
                    fresh
                    inspiration on how it’s done from having worked on ux companion. The app gained a popular
                    following
                    in
                    early October, as one of the first native apps to offer a full glossary of user experience terms
                    and
                    theory — but the development process was definitely a learning process.
                </p>

                <p>Commercializing side projects alongside client work isn’t easy. Even if such projects are
                    intended to
                    generate additional revenue streams, they are not directly related to your core business. Those
                    with
                    a more qualitative aim, such as promoting expertise or technological experimentation, are even
                    harder to justify.<br>
                    A significant shift in mindset is required to support either type of side project — weighing the
                    longer-term, incremental benefits against committing what would otherwise be immediately
                    billable
                    time. Many agencies do this with a time-bound model of 80% client time versus 20% time, inspired
                    by
                    Google’s successes with Gmail and Google Reader which they have since (tellingly) phased out.
                    I’d
                    instead recommend the following guidelines.
